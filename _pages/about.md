I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Binghamton University. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Penn State University and BS in Mathematics from Zhejiang University.

My research lies in the intersection of **data privacy**, **software security**, **machine learning** and **algorithmic fairness**. The overarching goal of my work is to protect sensitive personal information from being leaked in unintended ways. My current research focuses on <em>differential privacy</em> and its interactions with software security, formal verification, numerical optimization, statistical inference and machine learning.
